battle1.java -- Simple game without handling the exceptions and follows 1 block for one ship

battleShipAdvanced.java -- Advanced version using the same code with usecase to handle more complex game events such as:
1. 3 ships with different sizes.
2. cannot place a big ship without space.
3. cannot place a ship on another ship.
4. If you shoot outside the board - game doesnot break and you lose a chance.

run the JAVA file and enjoy ..:)
